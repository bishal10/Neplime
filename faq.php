            <ul>
                <li>You might also want to contact your bank and check the following:</li>
                <li>You have sufficient funds available</li>
                <li>Your card is active and not blocked</li>

                You may be charged a prepayment according to the property's prepayment policy. This is done to verify your credit card, where a temporary hold is placed on an amount until after check-out. It's best to contact the property for any questions about how you'll be charged.

            <div id="payment6" class="collapse">
                It's very likely, yes. Properties usually accept payment for a stay with a different card or cash. To confirm that paying with a different credit card is okay, contact the property.

                Properties request this to confirm your reservation. You may be pre-authorized* to ensure that your credit card is valid and has sufficient funds. In some cases, your details are used to pay for your stay when you book.
                <ul>
                    <li>*A pre-authorization is a temporary hold on an amount to ensure your card is valid and has sufficient funds. The amount held will be returned to your account after a certain period of time, depending on the property and your card provider.</li>

                <li>A pre-authorization, which is a a temporary hold on an amount to ensure your card is valid and has sufficient funds. The amount held will be returned to your account after a certain period of time, depending on the property and your card provider.</li>
                <li>A deposit or prepayment, which are required by some properties when you book. This is highlighted in your confirmation email. If you're eligible for free cancellation, this amount is returned to you when you cancel your booking.</li>
